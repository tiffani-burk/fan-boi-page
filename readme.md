#Fan Boi Page

#### Hello! This is a project I did for class called Fan Boi Page, where I coded a page with my favorite artists and tv shows. 

#### I incorporate HTML & CSS tools I've learned from Nashville Software School's UX/UI Digital Product Design course taught by Susan Culkin and Dani Crosby
